### Description

Set up this plugin to show the latest posts or tweets from your Facebook or Twitter account. You will need to create an app for the social network you want to use! To get access to the timeline of your Facebook Page or the tweets of your Twitter account, we need special tokens - which will be created when using an app.
The plugin will use these tokens to get the latest posts/tweets. You can set up at the settings how much posts or tweets should be shown, standard is 1. Links and Hashtags will be clickable.

At the moment you can use a widget to show up the latest news. Later on their will be possibly a shortcode.
In the widget you can set up an own "news" text which will be shown before the social media newsbox. And you can choose which social network should be shown at the widget: Facebook, Twitter or both.

This plugin uses the PHP SDK from Facebook and Twitter. Therefor there is no Javascript necessary!
